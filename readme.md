# Xarray-Healpy

**Xarray-Healpy** is designed to convert georeferenced data (latitude and longitude) into a Healpix grid (https://healpix.sourceforge.io) and make use of the array indexing system provided by **Xarray** (http://xarray.pydata.org).

We are interested in working with data of varying precisions within a Hierarchical Equal Area Grid and performing computations such as convolution, while taking into consideration land masks for oceanography studies.
